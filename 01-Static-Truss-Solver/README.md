## Methodology
- **Kinematic Determinacy:** Evaluates degrees of freedom $f = 2k - (a + s)$ where $k$ is nodes, $a$ is bearing constraints, and $s$ is structural bars.
- **Equilibrium Matrix Assembly:** Constructs the global equilibrium matrix $A$ using directional cosines between connected nodes.
- **Direct Solution:** Solves the linear system $r = A \backslash (-F)$ for internal bar forces and reaction loads.
- **Member Classification:** Automatically categorizes bars into **Tension** ($S_i > 0$, green), **Compression** ($S_i < 0$, red), and **Zero-Force** ($S_i = 0$, blue).
